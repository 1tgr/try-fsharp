        <![CDATA[<p>I got some great <strike>beta testing</strike>feedback on the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2115576">Hacker News comments for this site</a>. Try F# still relatively stable, although I'd like to go back and make the fsi.exe launching process a little more robust; I'm having to shut down old processes by hand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my amateur web programming skills have prevented the site from working in IE8 at the moment, likely due to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/08/protecting-your-cookies-httponly.html">HttpOnly cookies not being passed back to Javascript</a>. The only excuse I can attempt is that I've been testing on two browsers more commonly available on Mac OS X.</p>
<p>I'm planning on re-doing the Ajax mechanism -- which currently polls once a second for console output from the fsi.exe process -- and replacing it with long polling against a database of text output. That way I can decouple fsi.exe from the web app, and I can remove dependence on ASP.NET's session cookie.</p>
<p>Thanks all for your constructive feedback, and thanks in particular to IE users for your patience...</p>]]>
